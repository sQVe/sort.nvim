# üî† sort.nvim

**Sort** is a sorting plugin for [Neovim](https://neovim.io) that provides a simple command to mimic `:sort` and supports both line-wise and delimiter sorting. This plugin intelligently selects a sorting strategy by using a configurable priority list, minimizing manual input and covering most sorting cases with just the `:Sort` command on a range.

## ‚ùì Why

- Supports delimiter sorting.
- Intelligently selects a sorting strategy using a configurable priority list.
- Minimizes manual input required from the user.
- Efficient and lightweight.
- Mimics the functionality of Neovim's built-in `:sort` command where possible.
- Helps to satisfy the perfectionist in you by ensuring your text is neatly sorted.

## üì¶ Installation

#### [packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)

```lua
-- Lua.

use({
  'sQVe/sort.nvim',

  -- Optional setup for overriding defaults.
  config = function()
    require('sort').setup({
      -- Input configuration here.
      -- Refer to the configuration section below for options.
    })
  end,
})
```

#### [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)

```vim
" Vim Script.

Plug 'sQVe/sort.nvim'

" Optional setup for overriding defaults.
lua << EOF
  require("sort").setup({
    -- Input configuration here.
    -- Refer to the configuration section below for options.
  })
EOF
```

## ‚öô Configuration

**Sort** comes with the following defaults:

```lua
{
  -- List of delimiters, in descending order of priority, to automatically
  -- sort on.
  delimiters = {
    ',',
    '|',
    ';',
    ':',
    's', -- Space
    't'  -- Tab
   }
}
```

Sorting with the **Sort** plugin is made easy through the provided `:Sort` command. The plugin utilizes two different strategies depending on the visual selection:

- Multiple lines

  When selecting multiple lines, all arguments provided to `:Sort` are fed to the built-in `:sort` command, thereby mirroring all of the features provided by the built-in sort. See `:help :sort` for usage and options.

- Single line

  ```
  :[range]Sort[!] [delimiter][b][i][n][o][u][x]
  ```

  - Use `[!]` to reverse the sort order.
  - Use `[delimiter]` to manually set the delimiter instead of iterating over `config.delimiters` and sorting by the highest priority delimiter. Valid delimiters include:
    - Any punctuation character (!, ?, &, ...), matching the `%p` lua pattern character class.
    - `s`: Space
    - `t`: Tab
  - Use `[b]` to sort based on the first binary number in the word.
  - Use `[i]` to ignore the case when sorting.
  - Use `[n]` to sort based on the first decimal number in the word.
  - Use `[o]` to sort based on the first octal number in the word.
  - Use `[u]` to only keep the first instance of words within the selection. Leading and trailing whitespace are not considered when testing for uniqueness.
  - Use `[x]` to sort based on the first hexadecimal number in the word. A leading `0x` or `0X` is ignored.

## ‚å®Ô∏è Keybinding

**Sort** provides both command-based and motion-based sorting approaches.

### Command-based sorting (traditional)

For backward compatibility, you can still use the `:Sort` command. Here's how to set up keybindings:

```vim
" Vim Script.
nnoremap <silent> <leader>s <Cmd>Sort<CR>
vnoremap <silent> <leader>s <Esc><Cmd>Sort<CR>
```

```lua
-- Lua.
vim.keymap.set('n', '<leader>s', '<Cmd>Sort<CR>', { silent = true })
vim.keymap.set('v', '<leader>s', '<Esc><Cmd>Sort<CR>', { silent = true })
```

### Motion-based sorting (recommended)

**Sort** now provides motion mappings that work like native Vim operators. By default, the following mappings are available when you call `require('sort').setup()`:

| Mapping | Mode | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `go` | Normal | Sort operator (use with any motion) |
| `go` | Visual | Sort visual selection |
| `gogo` | Normal | Sort current line |
| `is` | Operator/Visual | Inner sortable region textobject |
| `as` | Operator/Visual | Around sortable region textobject |
| `]s` | Normal/Visual/Operator | Jump to next delimiter |
| `[s` | Normal/Visual/Operator | Jump to previous delimiter |

#### Examples:

```vim
" Sort a word
gow

" Sort inside parentheses
go(

" Sort 3 lines down
go3j

" Sort inside quotes using textobject
gois

" Sort around delimiters using textobject
goas

" Sort a paragraph
gop

" Quick line sort
gogo
```

### Customizing mappings

You can customize or disable the mappings by configuring them in setup:

```lua
require('sort').setup({
  mappings = {
    operator = 'gs', -- Change operator from 'go' to 'gs'
    textobject = {
      inner = 'ii', -- Change from 'is' to 'ii'
      around = 'ai', -- Change from 'as' to 'ai'
    },
    motion = {
      next_delimiter = ']d', -- Change from ']s' to ']d'
      prev_delimiter = '[d', -- Change from '[s' to '[d'
    },
  },
})
```

To disable mappings entirely, set them to `false`:

```lua
require('sort').setup({
  mappings = {
    operator = false, -- Disable operator mapping
    textobject = false, -- Disable textobject mappings
    motion = false, -- Disable motion mappings
  },
})
```

## üèÅ Roadmap

- [x] Extend support for delimiter sorting to mirror the options available in `:sort`:
  - [x] `b` option to sort by binary (2).
  - [x] `n` option to sort by decimal (10).
  - [x] `o` option to sort by octal (8).
  - [x] `x` option to sort by hexidecimal (16).
- [x] Improve test coverage to ensure the stability and reliability of the plugin.
- [x] Add opt-in motion mappings to enable users to trigger Sort commands more efficiently using keybindings.
- [ ] Add support for natural sorting to provide more intuitive sorting of strings that include numeric values.
