- **[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)**: Version history and changes

## ðŸš¨ Critical requirements

### Development workflow

- **Always run `./scripts/test`**: Run tests (executable script) after code changes

### Key implementation notes

- **Busted-style tests**: Use `describe`/`it`/`assert` with lazy.nvim minit runner
- **Strategy selection**: Automatic detection of optimal sorting approach (line vs delimiter)
- **Operator support**: `gs` operator with text objects (`is`, `as`) and motions (`[s`, `]s`)
